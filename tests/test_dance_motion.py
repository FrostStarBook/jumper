"""What `jumper.dance` gets wrong without saying so.

Every test here pins a failure that produces no error. A dance task is unusually
rich in them, because the reference is data rather than code: a clip read in the
wrong joint order, indexed against the wrong body list, or resampled off by a
frame produces arrays of exactly the right shape holding exactly the wrong
numbers, and training converges on all of them.

Where an assertion could pass vacuously it is paired with a **control group** --
the same assertion against a deliberately broken input, which must fail. Two of
these were written the obvious way first and passed against the bug they were
meant to catch; both say so.

## The material

Most of this file reads a real clip. The committed `demo.npz` means that is
normally there, so these tests run rather than skip -- which is the point of
committing it: a task configured by data needs its data exercised, and material
fetched through a side channel is material nobody checks against. The music it was
made for is not committed (its source could not be established) and is optional,
so the one test that measures a real track skips without one.

The skips are kept anyway, for the case where someone has swapped the demo out for
their own dance and taken it away again. `test_the_material_check_reports_what_is
_missing` covers the absent case itself, on a temporary directory rather than by
waiting for `media/` to be empty.

    robot's mirror rule, which is **not** "negate everything": the sign flips for a
    joint whose axis lies in the sagittal plane and is kept for one normal to it.
    `symmetry.py` has already measured which is which -- only the front arms'
    `J1` keeps its sign -- and this reads that table rather than restating it, so
    the two cannot drift apart. It reads the table and not the rule for a reason:
    `test_symmetry.py` restated the rule, agreed with a table the V1.6 rename had
    silently emptied, and passed.

    Written the obvious way first, assuming every pair negates, and it failed
    against a correct map: `LF_J1_joint` spans [-3.168, -0.843] and `RF_J1_joint`
    spans [-3.156, -0.845], both negative, which under a negate-everything rule
    looks like an error of 4.01 rad. That is also exactly what this test reported
    when the table went stale, which is what sent anyone looking at it.

    Measured on the sample clip: LF_J0 [-1.571, -0.349] against RF_J0
    [+0.349, +1.571]; LR_J2 [-2.198, -1.302] against RR_J2 [+1.307, +2.198].

    **The tolerance is 0.2 rad, and it is loose on purpose.** A choreography is not
    obliged to be symmetric, and this one is not quite: `LF_J2` sweeps
    [-0.957, -0.434] against `RF_J2`'s [+0.346, +0.957], so one end of the
    reflection matches to 0.000 rad and the other is out by 0.088. That is the
    dance, not the map. What a tolerance above it can still catch is a **gross**
    mis-assignment -- a `J0` column landing on a `J1`, which moves things by of
    order a radian.

    So this test does not catch a swapped leg pair, and nothing here should be read
    as though it did: an exchanged pair is still mirror-symmetric and satisfies this
    exactly. `test_every_leg_pair_swap_is_refused` is the one that covers that.

    The first version of this checked the mirror-range property above, and it does

    pair, so the ranges still satisfy it exactly. The check was blind to the one

    What does work is `_check_joint_limits`, and it covers all three. This robot's

    `native_sim.py` presents mjwarp's interface over plain MuJoCo and carries a
    deliberately short list of derived fields (`_DERIVED_FIELDS`); anything outside
    it raises `AttributeError` naming the field. That is a good error -- but only
    if something asks. Nothing in the config, the type checker or the other tests
    does, because every term involved is a perfectly ordinary mjlab term that
    happens to read a field one backend gathers and the other does not.

    So: build the environment on native and step it. A few steps and a handful of
    environments are enough -- the failure is on the first call to the offending
    term, not a slow divergence.

    ## It puts the seam back afterwards

    `use_backend` writes two module globals -- mjlab's `_SIMULATION_CLS` and
    `native_sim._DEFAULT_NTHREAD` -- and neither is scoped to anything. Left set,
    the thread count leaks into
    `test_resolve.py::test_backend_and_resolve_agree_on_the_default`, which then
    reads this test's `num_envs` (4) where it expects `DEFAULT_MAX_THREADS` (8).

    That leak is **not new** -- `test_servo_curve.py` calls `use_backend` the same
    way -- it was merely invisible, because pytest collects files in alphabetical
    order and `test_servo_curve` runs *after* `test_resolve`. This file begins with
    a 'd' and so runs before it, which is the only reason the leak ever showed. A
    test whose correctness depends on its filename is not one to rely on, so this
    one restores what it changed.

def test_every_actor_term_is_deployable_now_that_it_carries_its_recording() -> None:
    """This test used to assert the opposite, twice, and both were true then.

    First it said every actor term was deployable -- and it passed, because
    `_DEPLOY_TERMS` claimed all five of the terms that make this a dance while
    `deploy/fsm/src/obs.rs` had a case for none of them. The export would have
    succeeded, the bundle would have looked fine, and the robot would have
    thrown on the bench.

    Then it said the opposite: `jumper.dance` trains and replays and **cannot go
    on a robot**, recorded rather than left to be discovered, and pinned so that
    when the controller learned those terms it would fail and somebody would
    delete it on purpose. It did not fail when that happened, which is the third
    thing worth writing down: the four terms went into `_DEPLOY_TERMS` and
    `_REFERENCE_TERMS` at once, this test subtracted the second from the first,
    and the tripwire cancelled itself out. A test that cannot fail is not a
    weaker test, it is a different one.

    So it asserts the thing that is true now and is worth keeping true: every
    term this actor observes is one the deployment can build, and the ones that
    can only be built from a recording are exactly the ones this task's contract
